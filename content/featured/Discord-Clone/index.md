Kool-Kids-Snax allows the customer to place an order that notifies the restaurant via SMS who will then update the status of the order, which subsequently notifies the customer of the estimated pick up time. When the restaurant changes the order status to complete, the customer will receive a notice that their order is ready for pick up.
